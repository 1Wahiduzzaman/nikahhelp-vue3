        <p>
          We may disclose your Information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company 
          and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.

          In addition, we may disclose your Information to third parties:
          <ul class="nestedListDisk">
            <li>
              if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements; 
              or to protect the rights, property, or safety of matrimonyassist.com, our clients, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes 
              of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
            </li>
          </ul>

          Sometimes we use third parties to process your information on our behalf. We require these third parties (some of which may be based outside of the EEA) to comply strictly with our instructions 
          and we require that they do not use your Information for their own business purposes, unless you have explicitly consented to the use of your Information in this way. Any third parties who access 
          your data in the course of providing services on our behalf are subject to strict contractual restrictions to ensure that your data is protected, and in compliance with applicable data protection/privacy 
          legislation. We may also independently audit these service providers to ensure that they meet our standards.

        <h6>Data Storage</h6>

      <div class="docText">
        <div class="spacing">
          <p>
            All Information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Information, 
            we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our websites or other matrimonyassist.com services; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your Information, we will use strict procedures 
            and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
          </p>

          <p>
            We use security measures, including physical, administrative, and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information. These measures include encryption, security certificates, access controls, 
            information security technologies, policies, procedures and other information security measures to help protect your Information.
          </p>

          <p>
            When designing or implementing new computer systems and processes we look at ways to identify and mitigate potential security risks and then monitor and test our security systems to help protect your Personal Information.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where possible, we also try to anonymise information so that individuals can’t be identified from it. We analyse data about our users’ service uses patterns and habits, to help us improve our services, 
            how we display them on our website and so on. However, we don’t need to know who these service users are, we just need to know information such as how many connections made a certain teams at certain times, 
            or how many subscriptions bought over the course of times. So, instead of just putting all of our users’ information together and analysing it, we first remove the pieces of information that could identify them, 
            such as names, contact details, addresses and so on.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unless otherwise stated in one of the specific Privacy Notices, we will keep your Personal Information for three years then we will securely delete it.
          </p>

          <p>
            We do need to keep some anonymous information for longer than this, such as subscriptions habits and patterns, so we can analyse it to identify trends and changes in activity. We remove all names, 
            contact details and any other information that identify individual customers, so it’s all just anonymous numbers and data.
